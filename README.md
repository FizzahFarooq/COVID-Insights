This project focuses on analyzing the global spread and impacts of COVID-19 to identify key trends and vulnerable populations. The insights gained from this analysis can support the development of effective health policies and economic recovery strategies.

## Project Overview

The project involves data exploration, cleaning, and visualization to derive meaningful insights from the COVID-19 dataset. Key steps include:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset's structure, dimensions, and identifying missing or duplicated data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and removing duplicates to ensure data quality.
3. **Insights Extraction**: Identifying countries with the highest confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, as well as calculating global death and recovery rates.
4. **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the data, including bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts.
5. **Linear Regression**: Building a linear regression model to predict confirmed cases based on the number of deaths.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information on COVID-19 cases, including confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and other relevant metrics across different countries and regions.

## Key Insights

- **Country with the Highest Confirmed Cases**: Identified the country with the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
- **Country with the Highest Deaths**: Identified the country with the highest number of deaths due to COVID-19.
- **Country with the Highest Recoveries**: Identified the country with the highest number of recoveries.
- **Global Death and Recovery Rates**: Calculated the global death and recovery rates.
- **Top Countries by Recoveries and Deaths**: Listed the top 10 countries with the most recoveries and deaths.
- **Countries with Least Recoveries and Deaths**: Listed the countries with the least recoveries and deaths.

## Visualizations

- **Top 10 Countries by Total Deaths**: Bar chart showing the top 10 countries with the most deaths.
- **Top 10 Countries by Total Recovered Cases**: Bar chart showing the top 10 countries with the most recoveries.
- **Scatter Plot between New Cases and New Deaths**: Scatter plot showing the relationship between new cases and new deaths.
- **Case Distribution in China**: Pie chart showing the distribution of active cases, recoveries, and deaths in China.

## Linear Regression

A linear regression model was built to predict the number of confirmed cases based on the number of deaths. The model's performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
